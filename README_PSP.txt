GAMEPLAY
-------
The sequel to Nicky Boom; this time Nicky must find out who has been removing ladders and 
blocking off caves in his homeland. The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional 
maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork – hidden ladders 
are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are 
colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players. Mirrors are 
placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.

Although, save-game / level codes are currently not implemented, there are "secret" button combos, 
which enable a player to jump to next level and get bombs as well as other goodies.
